This is a Meme Generator App which I have created using ReactJS ( JavaScript's FrontEnd Framework) , inspired by 
React Tutorial from Scrimba .

You can setup the app on your Local Machine and have a look at my Project : 

PREREQUISITES : REACTJS DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT MUST BE SETUP ON YOUR SYSTEM . 
FOR SETTING UP THE REACT DEVELOPMENT ENVRIONMENT , YOU CAN REFER TO THE REACT DOCUMENTATION BY VISITING THE FOLLOWING LINK:
https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html


To play along with my project on your System, you need to follow the following Steps : 

Step 1 : 
Download all the Folders which are present in my "Meme Generator App using ReactJS" Repository on your Local Machine and copy them 
to a Separate New Folder on your System.

Step2:
After Step1 , Open Visual Studio Code or Any Editor(Like Sublime,WebStorm etc) and traverse to the Repository where you have created
the New Folder on your System and copied all the Files

Step 3 : 
Fire up your Terminal(If You're a MacOS User) or your Command Prompt(If you're a Window OS User) . Make Sure that you are 
in the Same Directory where your Folder is Present . 

Step4 : 
After Step3 , write the following command on your Terminal : 
`npm start ` and hit enter 

Step 5 : You're good to go now , the App will now be running live in your Browser and you can play along with it .
